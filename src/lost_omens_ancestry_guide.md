**What actions qualify for the requirements of the resonant weapon trait's Conduct Energy action?**

You can only use Conduct Energy with actions that have one of the required energy traits. Using an action other than a spell that causes damage with the listed trait does not necessarily qualify unless the action also has the trait.

For example, if you used the ifrit's Scorching Disarm action, you could channel fire energy into your weapon via Conduct Energy, as Scorching Disarm itself has the fire trait.

However, if you made a Strike with a flaming weapon, the Strike action does not have the fire trait, so you couldn't use Conduct Energy.

**Can nephilim characters take aasimar or tiefling feats from this book?**

Yes. Aasimar and tiefling feats from this book and any other book are available to nephilims, subject to rarity and GM ruling as normal. As with any legacy material, players may need to work with their GM to determine appropriate rulings, such as swapping references to good or evil damage with spirit damage with holy or unholy sanctification.

# Winglets
## Feat 5
-
;Kobold
You're among the few kobolds who grow a set of draconic wings later in life. The wings are initially small and weak; while not enough for full flight, a strong flap allows you to jump further. When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet (this additional distance isn't cumulative with the increased Leap distance from the Powerful Leap feat). You don't automatically fail your checks to High Jump or Long Jump if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you attempt a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet longer than you normally would based on the result of your Athletics check, though you still can't jump farther than your Speed.

# Fruit Leshy

Your body continually produces small fruits imbued with primal magic. At dawn each day, a new fruit ripens. You or an ally can remove this fruit as an Interact action. If a living creature that can derive sustenance from fruit consumes it as an Interact action within the next hour, they regain 1d8 Hit Points, plus an additional 1d8 Hit Points for every 2 of your levels beyond 1st. This effect has the healing, necromancy, positive, and primal traits.

# Beastkin (Rare Heritage)

The blood of a beast flows through your veins, granting you the ferocity and might of animals. Only creatures with the humanoid trait can take the beastkin versatile heritage. Choose a type of animal such as bat, eagle, shark, spider, tyrannosaurus, wasp, or wolf. This is the type of animal tied to your heritage and is known as your inherent animal. You gain the beast and beastkin traits, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. You gain the Change Shape ability (see below). A beastkin's hybrid form is their natural shape. You can choose from beastkin feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.

item (
# Animal Shape
## Feat 17
-
You have full control over your shape and can transform into your inherent animal. You can use Change Shape to enter an animal shape. When you gain this feat, choose either *aerial form*, *animal form*, *dinosaur form* or *insect form*; after you choose a form, you can't change the form. While in animal shape, you gain the effects of a 5th-level casting of your chosen form spell, except you always transform into an animal matching your inherent animal and can use your humanoid form's AC if it's higher than what the animal form grants. If your inherent animal isn't among the animals listed in the form, you default to the statistics and abilities of the bird battle form, cat battle form, deinonychus battle form, or ant battle form for *aerial form*, *animal form*, *dinosaur form*, and *insect form*, respectively (at the GM's discretion, you instead default to a different form that is closest to your inherent animal). You can remain in animal shape indefinitely and can use Change Shape to return to your humanoid or hybrid shape at any time.
    If you have the Critter Shape feat, you can choose to gain the effects of a 4th-level *pest form*, can remain in critter shape indefinitely, and can return to your critter shape at any time after leaving the shape, just as you can with Animal Shape.
