item(
# Dancing Blade ((+Dancing Blade))
## Cantrip 5
-
; uncommon,cantrip, evocation, psychic
**Cast** :aa:

**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 creature

**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute
-
You telekinetically animate a weapon that’s unattended or on your person. It brandishes itself at a foe of your choice as if wielded by an invisible duelist. When you first Cast the Spell, the weapon automatically flies to the target and Strikes. It moves along with its target, always remaining within reach. Each time you Sustain the Spell, the weapon either Changes Partners or Strikes. The weapon’s attacks use and contribute to your multiple attack penalty.
* **Change Partners** Change the weapon’s target to a different creature within 30 feet. The weapon flies to its new target.
* **Strike** (attack) The weapon attacks its target using your spell attack roll. On a hit, the weapon deals 3d6 damage of a type determined by the weapon (if the weapon has the versatile trait or can otherwise deal multiple types of damage, you choose each time you attack).
-
Heightened (+2) The damage increases by 1d6.
-
**Amp** The weapon’s attacks increase in strength, and your control is fine enough for advanced technique. The damage dice for the weapon’s Strike change from d6s to d10s. When you Cast or Sustain the spell, you can choose from the following options in addition to the standard ones.
    * **Guard** Rather than attacking, the weapon grants a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against melee attacks to the creature it’s following. The bonus lasts until the start of your next turn or until the weapon Changes Partners, whichever comes first.
    * **Push** (attack) The weapon attempts to Push its target, using your spell attack roll instead of an Athletics check to determine the results of the Push.

The Oscillating Wave, Page 19

## The Oscillating Wave ((+The Oscillating Wave))

At the heart of all things is energy. Though it may change its form or resting place, it is eternal, fundamental, the purest of building blocks. Your powers let you shift energy—either concentrating it in a single point to explosive end or freezing objects by plundering it away—in an endless oscillation of temperature.
**Granted Spells** 1st: *burning hands*; 2nd: *heat metal* (*Advanced Player’s Guide* 220); 3rd: *fireball*; 4th: *fire shield*; 5th: *cone of cold*; 6th: *flame vortex* (*Secrets of Magic* 106); 7th: *fiery body*; 8th: *polar ray*; 9th: *meteor swarm*
**Standard Psi Cantrips** *ignition* and *frostbite*
**Unique Psi Cantrips** surface: *thermal stasis*; deeper: *entropic wheel*; deepest: *redistribute potential*

### Conservation of Energy
Energy can’t be created or destroyed, only transferred or changed. Whenever you use your magic to add or remove energy, you must then balance it with the opposing force. The first time in an encounter that you cast a granted spell or standard psi cantrip from your conscious mind, decide whether you’re adding energy or removing it. Once you add energy, you must remove energy the next time you cast one of these spells. When you Refocus, you restore yourself to a neutral state, allowing you to once again freely choose whether you add or remove energy on your next spell.
    **Adding Energy:** The ability gains the fire trait, any damage it deals is fire damage, and any resistance it grants is to cold damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.
    **Removing Energy:** The ability gains the cold trait, any damage it deals is cold damage, and any resistance it grants is to fire damage. It loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals. Fiery body grants *frostbite* instead of *ignition* when cast this way.
    **Mindshift:** When you use an action that has the mindshift trait, you can choose to add or remove energy to it instead of making it mental. Alter it as normal for adding or removing energy and change any save it requires to a Reflex save.

|

### Ignition
You can drastically increase the heat against adjacent targets. When using *ignition* as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage (but not the persistent damage) from d4s to d6s. Your *ignition* also gains the following amp.

**Amp** You project pure heat that causes a target to combust. The initial damage changes to 1d10 fire damage (not adding your ability modifier) plus 1 fire splash damage. When using amped *ignition* as a melee attack, increase the damage dice of the initial damage from d10s to d12s. You are not harmed by splash damage from amped *ignition*.

**Amp Heightened (+1)** Instead of using *ignition*’s normal heightened entry, the initial damage increases by 1d10 (1d12 for melee) and the splash damage increases by 1. The persistent fire damage on a critical hit increases by 1d4.

### Frostbite
Your *frostbite* reaches even further. The range increases to 180 feet. Your *frostbite* also gains the following amp.

**Amp** You drain thermal energy at a distance, using what   you plunder to replenish yourself. The ray deals 1d10 cold damage. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage the target takes (after applying resistances and the like). You lose any remaining temporary Hit Points after 1 minute.

**Amp Heightened (+1)** The initial damage increases by 1d10 instead of 1d4.

You place a psychic lock in a foe’s mind that prevents it from a specific action.

If the creature attempts that action on its next turn, it must surmount your lock to do so, causing it to take 2d6 mental damage (with a basic Will save). The target is then temporarily immune for 1 minute.
-
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d6.
-
**Amp** Your telepathic push is particularly shocking to those who resist it. If the target fails its save, it’s also stunned 1.

## The Tangible Dream ((+The Tangible Dream))

**Granted Spells** 1st: *color spray*; 2nd: *mirror image*; 3rd: *sea of thought* (page 106); 4th: *resilient sphere*; 5th: *etheric shards* (page 105); 6th: *blade barrier*; 7th: *project image*; 8th: *scintillating pattern*; 9th: *prismatic sphere*

### Figment

Your minor illusions shift and dance. The range of *figment* increases to 60 feet. When you Sustain the spell, you can move the apparent sound or vision up to 15 feet. You can then attempt to Create a Diversion as usual. Those creatures who disbelieved the illusion aren’t affected by this diversion. Your *figment* also gains the following amp.

**Amp** When you amp the spell, you can create a particularly distracting illusion as part of its normal effects. Choose an unoccupied square within the spell’s range. The illusion in that square provides flanking for a single melee attack made before the beginning of your next turn. If you Sustain the spell, the details of the illusion change and shift to keep your enemies unsettled; the flanking illusion’s duration extends until the beginning of your next turn and you can move it to any unoccupied square in the spell’s range. The flanking illusion can’t provide its benefit against any creature who has disbelieved the *figment*.

### Shield
Your *shield* spell can be deployed on behalf of others. When you cast *shield*, you can choose a target ally within 30 feet to gain the benefits of the spell instead of you. The option to Shield Block with the spell is up to you and uses your reaction, not the target’s. Your *shield* also gains the following amp.
