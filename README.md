# Pathfinder Second Edition Errata

This project collects the errata published by Paizo for Pathfinder Second Edition and makes it easy to print for use in your game.

The `.md` files in the project use a modified markdown syntax understood by [scribe.pf2.tools](https://scribe.pf2.tools/). You can learn more about the syntax by examining the code for the example project found there. PDF versions of the errata pages can be found in the `PDFs` folder. Use the links below to edit the pages for yourself.
