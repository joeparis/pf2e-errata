# Wasp Guard
## Level 8
-
;invested,magical,necromancy
**Price** 487 gp

**Usage** worn armor; **Bulk** 1
-
Druids and Calistria's faithful alike value this vindictive armor for its ability to turn away pests and exact revenge on foes in a manner that can easily turn coordinated enemies into a chaotic mass. *Wasp guard* is *+1 studded leather* studded with the carapaces of wasps, subtly diverting swarms away and granting a +1 status bonus to Reflex saving throws against Swarming Bites, Swarming Stings, and similar abilities from swarms.

**Activate** :r: envision; **Frequency** once per day; **Trigger** An enemy within 30 feet Strikes you with an attack; **Effects** You animate the exoskeletons of the *wasp guard* armor into a spectral swarm of wasps that seeks revenge for the slight. The swarm flies to the triggering enemy's space and swarms about them, dealing 1d8 persistent poison damage. If the affected enemy has any allies within 30 feet, the enemy can spend a single action, which has the manipulate trait, to shoo the swarm away. This ends the persistent damage on that enemy automatically, but the swarm instead moves to affect the enemy's ally.
-
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include 1
Bulk of wasp exoskeletons.

# Dragontooth Club
## Item 13
-
;evocation,magical
**Price** '3,000' gp

**Usage** 'held in 1 hand'
-
Dragon teeth line the edges of this *+2 greater striking leiomano* (page 25). The leiomano also has a  *flaming*, *frost*, *shock*, or *corrosive* rune, as appropriate for the dragon from which the teeth were taken, which also grants the weapon the associated energy trait (for instance, fire for a club made with teeth  taken from a red dragon).

**Activate** :aa: Interact (evocation, magical); **Frequency** once per minute; **Effect** You swing the leiomano, sending several of the dragon teeth shooting through the air on jets of energy. The dragon teeth deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 damage of the energy type corresponding to the weapon in a 15-foot cone (DC 29 basic Reflex save). The teeth hunt down their targets, correcting their flight in midair, which reduces any circumstance bonus from cover by 2.
-
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include teeth from a dragon with a breath weapon that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or poison damage.

# Vine Whip
## Item 8
-
;magical,transformation
**Price** 500 gp
**Usage** held in 1 hand, **Bulk** 1
-
This *+1 striking whip* is crafted from the vine of a dangerous plant creature. It deals bludgeoning or slashing damage, according to the vine attack of the creature it was harvested from. For example, collecting a vine from an assassin vine would result in a *vine whip* that deals bludgeoning damage, while one from a mandragora or viper vine would deal piercing damage.
**Activate** :aaa: command, Interact; **Requirements** You have soil or sand within your reach; **Effect** You Release the weapon and plant it in the ground, where it takes root and fights on its own against the last enemy you attacked or the nearest enemy to it if your target has been defeated.
    The weapon has a space of 5 feet, acts on your initiative, and gains two actions. It doesn’t block or impede enemies attempting to move though that space, nor does it benefit from or provide flanking. The weapon can’t use reactions, and it acts on your turn.
    While Activated, a *vine whip* makes Strikes with an attack modifier of +22 plus its item bonus to attack   rolls (normally +24 total). It uses the weapon's normal damage but has a +0 Strength modifier. The whip's abilities that automatically trigger on a hit or critical hit still function, but the weapon can't be  Activated or benefit from any of your abilities while rooted.
    Each round, when the  *vine whip* is finished using its actions, attempt a DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the Activation ends and the *vine whip* becomes inanimate. You can't Activate the item again for 10 minutes. Removing the *vine whip* from the ground takes an Interact action.
    While rooted, the *vine whip* gains fast healing 1.
-
**Craft Requirements** The initial raw materials must include the vine from a plant creature with a vine attack.

Ooze ammunition is a capsule containing a sticky substance. If you hit a creature with activated ooze ammunition, it deals acid damage instead of its normal damage type, and the creature then takes the listed penalty to Speed and persistent acid damage until it ends the effects.

Other creatures can provide the actions, although doing so deals half the ammunition’s persistent acid damage to the assisting creature. A creature that ends the effect still takes the persistent damage that turn.

# False Death Vial
## Item 13+
-
;uncommon,conjuration,consumable,magical,talisman

unarmored defense category); **Bulk** -

**Activate** :f: envision; **Trigger** You would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by damage but not immediately killed; **Requirements** You are unarmored.
-
This tiny crystal vial of oily liquid is typically attached to a pin or worn on a tether attached to the affixed article of clothing. When you Activate the vial, you avoid being knocked out and remain at 1 Hit Point, your wounded condition increases by 1, and the talisman casts *drop dead* on you. You and any items you’re wearing and holding are instantly transported from your current space to a clear space of your choice within range. You take no damage from the triggering effect. If you are carrying another creature (even one contained inside an extradimensional container), it’s left behind in your original space.
-
**Type** *false death vial*; **Level** 13; **Price** 600 gp
-
**Type** greater *false death vial*; **Level** 16; **Price** 2,000 gp
The talisman also teleports you to a clear space of your choice that you can see within 120 feet. This also transports any items you’re wearing and holding with you, but if this would bring another creature with you—even if you’re carrying it in an extradimensional container—the teleportation is canceled. This effect has the teleportation trait.
